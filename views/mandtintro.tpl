<P ALIGN="right">This is Tilly, Mog's best friend. They live in the
same house, with Squeak the mouse. Tilly is meant to be a tabby - honest!</P>

<P ALIGN="left">This is Squeak. Poor Squeak lives with two cats, but

<P ALIGN="right">This is Foxi. He sometimes visits Mog and Tilly. Although,
he tries to be friends, no-one trusts him because he eats the chickens.
